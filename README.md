The Pack does not currently support removing locations from disabled Factions, but this should not matter much to the Logic. It can still be used with the new Goals and Options with no problem, you just may have Locations on the Tracker that you cannot access due to Options being different.

Support for changing the Tracker display with these new Options will come at a later time.
